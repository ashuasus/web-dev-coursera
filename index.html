            <h2 id="chicken">Chicken</h2>
            <p>A food rich in protein, chicken can help with weight management and reduce the risk of heart disease.
                Chicken contains the amino acid tryptophan, which has been linked to higher levels of serotonin (the
                “feel good” hormone) in our brains.</p>

            <h2 id="beef">Beef</h2>
            <p>Eating beef can help prevent iron deficiency anemia in people who are at risk. Beef is a good source of
                zinc, which the body needs to heal damaged tissue and support a healthy immune system. Children and
                adolescents also need healthy amounts of zinc to make sure they thrive and grow.</p>

            <h2 id="sushi">Sushi</h2>
            <p>Many of the ingredients commonly found in sushi can help you maintain long-term health and prevent
                diseases. Fish, for example, contains Omega-3 fatty acids, which can help fight conditions like heart
                disease and stroke. Ginger, which is commonly served with sushi, can also help protect against
                respiratory viruses.</p>
